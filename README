# ESP8266WifiConfig

It's a fully-featured Arduino library for ESP8266 which initiate and write WIFI configurations to EEPROM through a self-serving Web.

The idea and some code parts are from https://github.com/nikant/espWiFi2eeprom.

# Features
It will try to connect to the AP by the configurations written in EEPROM automatically.

Once the connection failed, it will start a new AP and provide a web interface for the configurations.

**optional**
A web service can be enabled to provide information page, restart & reset functions.
